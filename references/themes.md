# Themes Catalog

Every theme is a CSS token override in `assets/themes/`. Switch themes by
changing `<link id="theme-link">`, or by pressing **T** when the deck has
`data-themes="a,b,c"` on `<html>` or `<body>`.

All themes share the same variables from `assets/base.css`: `--bg`,
`--bg-soft`, `--surface`, `--surface-2`, `--border`, `--text-1`, `--text-2`,
`--text-3`, `--accent`, `--accent-2`, `--accent-3`, `--good`, `--warn`,
`--bad`, `--grad`, `--grad-soft`, radius, shadow, and font tokens.

## Theme Selection Rule

For each real deck, choose **exactly 3 themes from all 37**:

1. **Default** — the best fit for the audience and delivery setting.
2. **Softer alternate** — calmer, lighter, or more approachable.
3. **Expressive alternate** — more dramatic, visual, or memorable.

The first theme must match both `data-themes` and `theme-link`:

```html
<html lang="zh-CN" data-themes="corporate-clean,soft-pastel,aurora" data-theme-base="../assets/themes/">
<link rel="stylesheet" id="theme-link" href="../assets/themes/corporate-clean.css">
```

Do not hardcode the same three themes for every deck. `soft-pastel` and
`aurora` are useful candidates, not universal defaults.

## How To Extend

Copy an existing theme, rename it, and override only the variables you need.
Keep each theme short and token-driven. Prefer token changes over new selectors
so runtime UI, animations, and layouts remain theme-aware.
